# HololiveEN-colorschemes
Color schemes based on the Hololive's EN branch

## State
Terminal, Iterm2: kind of complete
Base16: kind of complete but I didn't tested it
Vim: I have *no idea* where to put each colors
The color palette is *good* (**too much** colors)

## Misc
I kind of just copied the colorscheme [reki](https://github.com/machakann/vim-colorscheme-reki "reki colorscheme") by [machakann](https://github.com/machakann "machakann") so all credits go to him.

The colors was based of the EN branch's talents from [Hololive](https://en.hololive.tv/ "Hololive's offical website") and their characters illustrators/designers so all credits go to them too.
