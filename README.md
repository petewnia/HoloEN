## Credits and Misc
The colors was based of the EN branch's talents from [Hololive](https://en.hololive.tv/ "Hololive's offical website") and their characters illustrators/designers so all credits go to them too.

Font are Migmix 2M which I add a slashed zero, stole from Migmix 1M, They can be found [here](http://mix-mplus-ipa.osdn.jp/migmix/ "Migmix")

Personally, I use underline cursor but if you use box and find the cursor text's color too bright. Try change it to the foreground color.
