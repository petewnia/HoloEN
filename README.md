Color schemes based on the Hololive's EN branch

The color palette is *good* (**too much** colors)

## Credits and Misc
I kind of just copied the colorscheme [reki](https://github.com/machakann/vim-colorscheme-reki "reki colorscheme") by [machakann](https://github.com/machakann "machakann") so all credits go to him.

The colors was based of the EN branch's talents from [Hololive](https://en.hololive.tv/ "Hololive's offical website") and their characters illustrators/designers so all credits go to them too.

Font are Migmix 2M which I add a slased zero, stole from Migmix 1M, They can be found [here](http://mix-mplus-ipa.osdn.jp/migmix/ "Migmix")
